# Sale Price Feature Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
When adding new items to the inventory system, there was no way to set a sale price during item creation. This forced guessing when selling items, as there was no predefined sales price for customers.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Model Changes**
- **File**: `Models\Item.cs`
- **Changes**: Added `SalePrice` property (nullable decimal) with intelligent pricing logic
- **Features**:
  - `SalePrice` - Optional field to store predefined sale price
  - `HasSalePrice` - Computed property to check if sale price is set
  - `SuggestedSalePrice` - Intelligent property that returns either the set sale price or calculates one based on item type

### 2. **ViewModel Updates**
- **File**: `ViewModels\CreateItemViewModel.cs`
- **Changes**: Added `SalePrice` property with validation and currency formatting

### 3. **Controller Updates**
- **File**: `Controllers\ItemsController.cs`
- **Changes**: Updated Create action to handle SalePrice field

- **File**: `Services\InventoryService.cs`
- **Changes**: Updated UpdateItemAsync method to include SalePrice in updates

### 4. **View Updates**
- **File**: `Views\Items\Create.cshtml`
- **Changes**: Added Sale Price input field with:
  - Currency formatting ($)
  - Intelligent pricing guidance based on item type
  - Contextual help text

- **File**: `Views\Items\Edit.cshtml`
- **Changes**: Added Sale Price field with:
  - Current price display
  - Smart pricing information showing whether price is set or calculated

- **File**: `Views\Sales\AddItem.cshtml`
- **Changes**: Enhanced to show:
  - Visual indicator when item has predefined sale price vs calculated price
  - Badge showing "Set Price" (green) or "Calculated" (blue)

### 5. **Sales Integration**
- **File**: `Controllers\SalesController.cs`
- **Changes**: Updated `CheckProductAvailability` action to:
  - Prioritize predefined sale prices over cost-based calculations
  - Return `hasSalePrice` flag for UI indicators
  - Provide intelligent pricing for both inventory and non-inventory items

### 6. **Database Migration**
- **File**: `add_saleprice.sql`
- **Changes**: SQL script to add SalePrice column to Items table
- **Instructions**: Run this script against your database to add the new column

## Key Features

### Intelligent Pricing
The system now provides smart pricing suggestions based on item type:
- **Service Items**: $50-150/hour default, 200% markup if cost-based
- **Virtual Items**: $25-100 per license, 300% markup if cost-based  
- **Subscriptions**: $15-50/month, 150% markup if cost-based
- **Utilities**: Based on usage/cost, 20% markup if cost-based
- **Physical Items**: Cost + 50% markup default

### User Experience Improvements
- **Clear Visual Indicators**: Users can immediately see if an item has a predefined price
- **Contextual Guidance**: Pricing suggestions are provided during item creation
- **Intelligent Defaults**: Sales forms auto-fill with appropriate prices
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing items work fine without sale prices set

## How to Use

### For New Items
1. When creating an item, optionally set a Sale Price
2. If no sale price is set, the system will calculate appropriate suggestions during sales

### For Sales
1. When adding items to sales, the system will:
   - Use predefined sale price if available (shows "Set Price" badge)
   - Calculate appropriate price based on cost and item type (shows "Calculated" badge)
   - Automatically fill the price field with the best suggestion

### Migration
1. Run the `add_saleprice.sql` script on your database
2. Optionally, go through existing sellable items and set sale prices
3. The system works immediately - no existing functionality is broken

## Benefits
- **Eliminates Guessing**: No more uncertainty about what to charge customers
- **Consistent Pricing**: Predefined prices ensure consistency across sales
- **Flexible**: Works for all item types (inventory, service, virtual, etc.)
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing items continue to work without changes
- **Smart Defaults**: System provides intelligent suggestions when no price is set
